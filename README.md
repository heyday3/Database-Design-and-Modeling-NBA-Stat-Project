# Database-Design-and-Modeling-NBA-Stat-Project
This project was completed to explore relational databases using MySQL Workbench. Our team decided to build a database of statistics from the 2018-2019 NBA Eastern Conference season. Our work consisted of identifying an end-user need for a relational database, determining the requirements for the database, developing a deadline-oriented plan for building the database, designing the logical specifications, building and populating the database, and developing queries/views that will showcase the capabilities of the database for fulfilling the identified user needs.
